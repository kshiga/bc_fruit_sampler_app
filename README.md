# Fruit Sampler App

This application was created as an exercise to display the technical abilities of Kaitlyn Higa in relation to their candidacy with BeautyCounter in November 2020.

### Delivery Requirements
#### Backend Requirements
- [x]  Build a Node js server that creates an API that returns information on various Fruit.
- [x] Fruit have the following properties: Name, weight, image.
- [x] The API should allow consumers to query by name, but not weight.
- [x] The API should handle cases where a query does not exist.

#### Front End Requirements
- [x] Build a web page with an input field that a user can interact with.
- [x] The input field should query the API and return all matching fruit.
- [x] The webpage should render the fruit on the page and display a caption with the name of the fruit, and the weight.
- [x] The images + captions should be center aligned on the page. All images should render at the same dimensions on the page.
